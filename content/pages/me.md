I’m Tania Rascia, a web developer, technical writer, and former chef from Chicago. I currently work as a front end software engineer and I've written for many [developer publications](/publications).

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while going through a [career change](/how-i-made-a-career-change-into-web-development/). I [learn in public](/learn) and write about everything I know.

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
